**Problem:**  
In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, high-quality, real-time intelligence is fragmented and expensive. Traders and researchers are forced to toggle between dozens of tabs—price charts, news aggregators, on-chain explorers, and social sentiment tools—just to form a basic market thesis. Furthermore, accessing premium AI-driven insights typically requires expensive monthly subscriptions, creating a high barrier to entry for casual users.

**Solution:**  
**Arcana** is a decentralized, multi-agent AI orchestrator that acts as your personal crypto intelligence analyst. Unlike generic chatbots, Arcana doesn't just "guess"; it actively coordinates a fleet of specialized sub-agents to fetch live, verifiable data from the blockchain and the web. Whether you need the latest funding rates, a breakdown of token vesting schedules, or a summary of breaking news, Arcana synthesizes it all into a single, comprehensive answer.

**Unique Features & Benefits:**  
*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: A single query triggers parallel work from specialized agents (Price Oracle, News Scout, Chain Scout, Perp Stats, Tokenomics, and NFT Scout).
*   **Powered by x402**: We leverage x402 on Base Sepolia for fast micro-payments between agents. The orchestrator pays sub-agents per-call in real time.
*   **Pay-As-You-Go**: No subscriptions. Users pay a flat, transparent fee of $0.03 USDC per query on Base Sepolia.
*   **Universal Access**: Users can fund their wallet with testnet USDC and start using Arcana immediately.

**Target Audience:**  
Arcana is built for crypto traders, DeFi researchers, and enthusiasts who demand institutional-grade insights without the complexity. It bridges the gap between raw data and actionable intelligence, making advanced market analysis accessible to everyone via a simple chat interface.
