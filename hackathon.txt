ntroduction
The San Francisco Agentic Commerce x402 Hackathon is a 3-day hybrid hackathon bringing together builders in AI, agentic commerce, x402, Google AP2/A2A, ERC-8004, Web3, DeFi, and payments to ship real-world demos in agentic commerce systems where autonomous agents can act as real buyers and sellers.

About us
SKALE is a network of Layer 1 blockchains built for the Internet of Agents. It enables agent-driven applications with commerce-grade privacy, fast execution, and scalable-by-default performance. SKALE achieves this with a horizontally scalable network of high-performance EVM blockchains that support private execution, instant finality, and gasless transactions. It is designed for agentic commerce flows and standards such as x402 for payments, AP2 for settlements, and ERC-8004 for orchestration. At the core is Blockchain Integrated Threshold Encryption (BITE), which keeps sensitive transaction details encrypted until finality and enables conditional transactions without leaking balances, intent, or strategy.
